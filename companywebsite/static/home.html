            Business model
            <br>
            Supercell focuses on the development of free-to-play games that
            yield profits through the in-game micropayments. The company's 
            objective is to focus on the successful games that stay popular for years.
            The focus has not been on revenue, but on the principle "just design something 
            great, something that users love."[7] Game development focuses around "cells" of 
            five to seven people which start with idea generation and an initial review by 
            CEO Paananen.[7] The team subsequently develops the idea into a game, which the 
            rest of the company's employees get to play-test, followed by play-testing in 
            Canada's iTunes App store; if the Canada reception is good, the next step is global 
            rollout (via iTunes).[7] Successful failures are celebrated by employees.
            [7] One of the games that was cancelled well into development was Battle Buddies, 
            which had also been rated well in the test market, but the number of players was still 
            too small. The final decision for cancelling a project is done by the development 
            team themselves.
